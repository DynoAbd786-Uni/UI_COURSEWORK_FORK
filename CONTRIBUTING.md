# COMMITING

**Lets not commit our branches randomly without a plan**
**And also lets not merge our pull requests immedietly**

To get a local copy of the repo, run ```git clone git@github.com:sc22my/UI_COURSEWORK.git```. You should create a branch using ```git branch new_branch_name``` (make sure you git checkout new_branch to change the active branch to your new one) and commit your progress there. Once you are ready to merge your branch create a pull request by either:
* Using gitub app or cli: ```gh pr create```.
* Push your branch to the repo and create a pull request on github website.

**Try to avoid commiting code straight to main, but small stuff like updating few lines of docs are ok**

# CURLY BRACKETS
Must be inline
```
void my_func(args) {
    sjdksjdksjdksjdk;
}
```

# COMMENTS
Use javadoc format????
```
/**
* @param stuff does stuff
*/
void do_thing(stuff) {
    blah blah;
}
```

# GITHUB ISSUES
If you have questions/suggestions feel free create an issue on github and let the rest of us know on discord?
